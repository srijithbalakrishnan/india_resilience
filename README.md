# India District-Level Infrastructure and Community Vulnerability Data

This repository contains open-source data, methodology, and results from a study on district-level infrastructure access, availability, and community vulnerability in India. The study develops composite indicators for critical, essential, and social infrastructure systems, and examines their spatial associations with community vulnerability across 733 districts using spatial regression and clustering analysis.  

The analysis identifies distinct infrastructure profiles that explain spatial inequalities in vulnerability and provides insights for equitable and targeted infrastructure investments.

## 1. Results and Data

### 1.1 Composite Indicators

Composite indicators for district-level infrastructure characteristics and community vulnerability are calculated across four dimensions:  

- **Critical Infrastructure (CI‚Ççcrit‚Çé):** Availability of key physical systems such as road networks, energy grids, and transport connectivity.  
- **Essential Utility Access (CI‚Ççess‚Çé):** Household-level access to electricity, drinking water, sanitation, and clean cooking fuel.  
- **Social Infrastructure (CI‚Ççsoc‚Çé):** Density of educational, health, and safety facilities such as schools, hospitals, and police stations.  
- **Community Vulnerability (CI‚Ççcomm‚Çé):** Composite index representing socioeconomic sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity indicators.  

#### 1.1.1 Composite Indicator Maps

All composite indicators are derived by applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on normalized infrastructure and community features (using standard scaling).  
A positive value indicates above-average capabilities, while a negative value indicates below-average performance.

```

### 1.2 Infrastructure and Vulnerability Data

This section includes the **raw and processed datasets** used to compute infrastructure and vulnerability indicators. These datasets form the basis for reproducing the spatial analysis.

Key indicators include:  
- **Infrastructure indicators:** e.g., road density, hospital availability, utility service coverage.  
- **Vulnerability indicators:** e.g., literacy, household composition, and financial resilience.  

#### 1.2.1 Data Sources

The district-level infrastructure and vulnerability data were compiled from multiple national and open datasets, including:  

- OpenStreetMap  
- ESRI India  
- UDISE+ (Ministry of Education, Government of India)  
- State economic censuses and budget documents  
- National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

### 1.3 Cluster Analysis: Infrastructure and Vulnerability Profiles

Districts are grouped into **six distinct clusters** based on shared infrastructure and vulnerability characteristics.  
The clustering integrates **spatial regression outputs** and **composite indicators** to reveal inter-district similarities and disparities in access, availability, and social infrastructure.  

- **Clustering method:** Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering  
- **Validation:** Silhouette and Calinski‚ÄìHarabasz indices  
- **Outputs:** Spatial cluster maps and average infrastructure profiles per cluster  

#### 1.3.1 Spatial Infrastructure‚ÄìVulnerability Profiles

Statistical distributions of infrastructure characteristics were mapped to highlight unique infrastructure profiles and spatial disparities.

## 2. Methods

The methodological framework integrates **spatial econometric modeling** with **composite indicator analysis** to capture multidimensional infrastructure‚Äìvulnerability linkages.  

Four main stages were followed:

1. **Indicator Development:**  
   High-resolution geospatial, demographic, and infrastructural datasets were processed and standardized to construct composite indicators for critical, essential, and social infrastructure dimensions, as well as community vulnerability.  

2. **Spatial Analysis:**  
   A **Spatial Lag Model (SLM)** was applied to quantify both direct and spillover associations between infrastructure characteristics and community vulnerability, accounting for spatial dependence across neighboring districts.  

3. **Cluster Analysis:**  
   The resulting marginal effects were aggregated and analyzed through clustering to identify typologies of infrastructure access and availability.  

4. **Statistical Modeling:**  
   The association between community vulnerability and infrastructure dimensions was examined using **linear regression** on the composite indicators.
